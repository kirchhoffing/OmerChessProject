# Chess-AI-Unity

Originally Created in a 1 week deadline in Qt 4.8 and ported within a day.

Castling removed due to time constraints.

Has one known issue:
AI sometimes sacrifices king if it finds that to lead to a better board state where all paths lead to both kings dead.

Issue is an easy fix and will be fixed in the future.
